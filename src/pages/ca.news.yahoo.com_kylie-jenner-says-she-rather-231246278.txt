I could not handle the weird accent,” Jenner quipped back. However, the makeup mogul went on to clarify that she would make an exception if her significant other already had an accent. “Unless he had a weird accent, like naturally. If he had an accent, fine,” Jenner told Karanikolaou.

The hypothetical situation comes after a source told PEOPLE in March that Jenner and rapper Travis Scott, with whom she shares 2-year-old daughter Stormi, are in a “great” place — but not officially a couple again after taking some time apart in October. “Things are great with Kylie and Travis,” the source says. “They are very happy. Kylie still isn’t labeling their relationship. It seems they aren’t seeing other people, though.” RELATED: Kylie Jenner Posts Flirty Throwback Photos of Herself with Ex Travis Scott: ‘It’s a Mood’ In February, Jenner shared a series of throwback photos on her Instagram Stories showing her and Scott, 27, getting cozy while sitting courtside at a 2017 Houston Rockets vs. Oklahoma City Thunder basketball game. “It’s a mood,” she wrote over the photos.
