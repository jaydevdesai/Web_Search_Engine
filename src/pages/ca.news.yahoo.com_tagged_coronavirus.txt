News The Canadian Press Passengers on COVID-19-stricken cruise ships hope to be on land again soon Two cruise ships with Canadian passengers aboard finally docked Thursday in Florida after weeks at sea and days of negotiations with initially resistant local officials.The MS Zaandam and a sister ship, the MS Rotterdam, were both given permission to unload passengers at Port Everglades after reaching an agreement with officials who feared they would divert needed resources from a region that has seen a spike in virus cases.Earlier Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the Canadians would stay in isolation upon their return to Canada. Trudeau said a chartered plane would carry asymptomatic Canadian passengers aboard the ships home in the coming days, though he didn't provide an exact timeline.But Catherine McLeod of Ottawa, who was on the Zaandam with her husband before they were transferred to the Rotterdam, said she was preparing to come home, even before American officials gave the ships the go-ahead to dock in Florida."It's kind of a done deal we're getting off this pleasure cruise," McLeod said in a phone interview from her cabin. "So we're very, very hopeful. I will feel 100 per cent better once the plane lifts off the runway. It's going to be one hell of a Hallelujah hoot going up then."She said she and her husband were waiting for a medical check-up to make sure they remained asymptomatic before getting their "disembarkation" papers."I think what they're trying to do is get our fannies on a bus and outta here ASAP," McLeod said.Holland America, which operates the cruises, said U.S. officials at the local, state and national levels cleared both ships to dock on Thursday afternoon, and would allow all guests fit to travel to disembark."Guests who still have symptoms will remain on board and disembark at a later date to be finalized after they have fully recovered," the cruise line said.Global Affairs Canada said the passengers would be screened after the ships docked. It said passengers showing no symptoms will travel to Canada on a flight chartered by the cruise line."Once here, they will be screened again and subject to mandatory 14-day self-isolation," the department said in a release. "Passengers who display symptoms after disembarking the ships will be treated locally."The docking plan indicated that Florida residents would leave the ship first, with the disembarkation of all passengers not concluding until Friday night.For nearly three weeks, passengers have not been able to leave the ships, and four elderly passengers have died on the Zaandam — at least two from COVID-19, ship owner Carnival Cruise Lines said in a statement.There are 442 guests and 603 crew on the Zaandam, and 808 guests and 583 crew on the Rotterdam, which was sent last week to take in some of the passengers and provide assistance to the Zaandam since it was denied permission to dock at ports in South America.Holland America said 97 guests and 136 crew members on the ships have developed flu-like symptoms.Initially, 248 Canadians were aboard the MS Zaandam, Global Affairs has said. As for what happens when they return to Canada, the details remain fuzzy."My understanding is they will be flown home on a charter flight but we are still looking for those details and we will ensure they are isolated when they get home," Trudeau said.He did not specifically say if passengers from the ships will be required to remain in quarantine at federal quarantine centres, like passengers from the Diamond Princess and Grand Princess were in February and March.Chris Joiner of Ottawa, who remains on the Zaandam, said in written messages that he's been told he may be able to disembark on Friday if Florida grants the necessary permissions."People are so bored. Some sleep all the time. I mean, booze is free but you can’t get drunk every day," Joiner said.He said the once-lively cruise ship has quieted in the last week."The only thing you hear is food being delivered, dishes picked up and the odd knock when your garbage can is emptied or they dropped off clean towels or booze," he said.Meanwhile, a Toronto couple who were transferred over to the Rotterdam said they were trying to keep their heads up before ultimately putting this disaster behind them."Here we are on day 24 of a 14-day cruise!" Kevin and Jeannette Balgopal wrote in an email on Wednesday. They said the cruise company and captain were providing as much reassurance as they could under the circumstances.The couple has been confined to their cabin for fear a half-hour of daily "fresh air time" would "jeopardize any attempts to get us to dock," the Balgopals wrote.

Ad RagingBull How He Made $2.8M Trading Stocks Part-Time At Home Kyle Dennis took a leap of faith and decided to invest his savings of $15K in the stock market — $2.8M later, he owes his success to these strategies News The Canadian Press Stock market crash may force some investors to postpone retirements, say experts TORONTO — The biggest market downturn in more than a decade has rattled nerves and may ultimately force some investors to postpone their approaching retirements, say experts."I do see that this is going to be impactful for the average Canadian out there because you know, not everybody, unfortunately, plans," says Chris Gandhu, vice-president high net worth planning for TD Wealth Advisory Services.A well-developed plan designed years before the expected date of retirement can help to control these "black swan events."Even those that should be good on paper, including Gandhu's mother, may feel anxious about their plans."I think she's in a decently good spot. But of course, she's rethinking everything and wondering whether she needs to work a bit longer," he said from Calgary.The TSX/S&P Composite Index is down 25 per cent from its record high after losing as much as 38 per cent of its value in a little over a month as markets were rattled by the economic impact of the novel coronavirus.The swift market plunge has prompted workers to re-examine their plans to see if their post-retirement goals have changed.For example, those with dreams of travelling in the first couple years of retirement may no longer feel comfortable doing so because of the global pandemic."I don't know if many people are going to be looking to take a cruise in the next year or two," said Ed Lee, vice president of Morneau Shepell’s retirement practice.Even the most conservative investment strategy has netted a significant retirement cushion over the 12-year bull run but also fostered a sense of complacency.Adjusting expenses until a recovery occurs may be an alternative to delaying retirement, says Manmeet Bhatia, head of private wealth Franklin Templeton Canada."You might want to extend your working years a little longer, but you also may want to look at your spending habits," he said.He said investors can't count on a quick recovery. That's especially true for sectors such as the hospitality industry that could face significant layoffs.Bhatia said the best way to control large swings in the equity market is through a balanced portfolio that consists of equities, fixed income, a multitude of sectors and geographies."The reality is there's going to be major corrections that can occur at inopportune times — you know exactly like what we're facing now," he said.The situation is likely to be more stressful for those with defined contribution pension plans, rather than defined benefit plans that guarantee a retirement payout regardless how markets perform."The current market problems are much more impactful to people that are much closer to retirement, because those are the people that may be need the market to return to normal in three or six or nine months, but it might take two years for the market to fully rebound, to where it once was," said Joseph Nunes, co-founder and executive chairman of Actuarial Solutions Inc. and author of a paper entitled “The Power of Postponed Retirement.” Nunes suggests that the Canadian government should extend the age to invest in tax-sheltered securities to 75 from 71.In the meantime, Finance Minister Bill Morneau has addressed the impact of the virus on older investors by reducing the minimum withdrawal from registered retirement income funds by 25 per cent in 2020."It was an acknowledgment that forcing people to get money out of their retirement savings at age 71, 72, etc, especially when the markets have taken a hit is not necessarily in everyone's best interest for the long haul," Nunes said in an interview. Baby boomers aren't always the most financially secure despite their long employment records.They account for one out of eight consumer insolvency filings in Canada and have seen the largest increase in filings in the past five years, said Pierre Fortin, CEO of insolvency firm Jean Fortin & Associates.And now they will be among the most financially affected by job losses due to COVID-19 because as the most susceptible to contracting the virus, they may be forced to remain at home and would be the first to be laid off.While this cohort would have had an easy time in the near full-employment pre-COVID labour market, they will face stiff competition from many younger people looking for jobs if their employers cease operations."Postponing retirement to pay off consumer debts and mortgages was a necessity for many baby-boomers," he wrote in an email. "Post-COVID-19 will create hardships for everyone but more so for those 65+ age groups whose consumer debts surpass their net annual income.”The fact that some investors were forced to adjust their retirement date because of the recent market fluctuations means something went wrong with their retirement plan, says Sylvain Brisebois, national sales manager at BMO Private Wealth.That's because retirement is about cash flow that is visible several years in advance of retirement."You can be asset rich and cash poor and that's a deadly combination for retirement," he said.Retirement cash flow should come from interest payments, dividends and bond maturities that are predictable and secure.Asset sales could be part of the plan, but it should be flexible enough to put off any sales until the market recovers."If you are stuck selling assets, now, you've really you've really messed up," he said.This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 2, 2020.Ross Marowits, The Canadian Press News Jon Rumley Spain Salutes Hospital Cleaning Staff During COVID-19 Pandemic Cleaners are sanitizing health-care facilities to keep everyone safe.
