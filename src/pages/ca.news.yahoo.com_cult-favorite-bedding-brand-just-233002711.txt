If you haven’t stocked up on cozy bedding to get you through the foreseeable future, now’s your chance to shop a coveted comforter at a discount — but only this weekend. You’ve probably heard of Brooklinen because of its online popularity. The brand, which has deemed itself the maker of “the internet’s favorite sheets,” is beloved by thousands for its soft and comfortable bedding. And while it rarely puts its products on sale, you can snag both its down comforter and down alternative comforter for 15 percent off until April 5. Plus, if you’re in the market for sheets, pillows, towels, or even loungewear, you can snag 10 percent off everything else on the site until midnight ET as well. Brooklinen Buy It!
