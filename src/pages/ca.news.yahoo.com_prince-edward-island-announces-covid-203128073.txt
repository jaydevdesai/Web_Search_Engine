Finance Minister Darlene Compton announced late Friday that the 2019-20 deficit is due to the COVID-19 pandemic driving up costs and reducing revenues. Compton said prior to the pandemic emerging over the past month, the province had anticipated a $2.5-million surplus. The minister also confirmed the province is adding $15 million to its emergency contingency fund and will allow for deferral of property taxes and fee payments until the end of this year. She told reporters during the briefing that the province expects it's going to have to borrow more money than anticipated in 2020-21 fiscal year due to the pandemic, though she didn't name a figure. "You can basically confirm we will be adding to the province's debt," said Compton. "We've borrowed $25 million, and we're increasing that to $40 million. And it's the early days of the pandemic." Premier Dennis King said his Progressive Conservative government is willing to incur deficits and increase debt "because we're living in a time when governments need to step up to the plate." "The economic hangover isn't something we'll be rid of by Canada Day .... It will linger on for months and years," he said. Government documents says economic growth has been revised down, and that the number of people thrown out of work or facing reduced hours is expected to hit 20,200 by May. "The ultimate severity and duration of the closures and social distancing restrictions are unknown and will depend on evidence of community transmission of the virus," the documents say. This report by The Canadian Press was first published April 3, 2020.
