The urgent need for action was made clear on Thursday, when Dr Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, issued a plea for states to force people not to leave their homes. “I don’t understand why it’s not happening,” said Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “We really should be.” Here are five states who have taken the least action: Alabama The deep south state of Alabama has resisted implementing a statewide stay-at-home order, despite it having, as of Friday, 1,270 confirmed coronavirus cases. The lack of action is particularly troubling as Alabama’s population is especially vulnerable to infectious disease. The state had the third-most deaths from flu in 2018.

The state’s governor, Kay Ivey, has been evasive when asked about a stay-at-home order. “Each state has to weigh their own set of factors,” she responded during a Q&A on Thursday. Ivey has defied Alabama’s US senator, Doug Jones, who has urged officials to act. Arkansas Arkansas is another southern state yet to order residents to stay at home, despite parts of the state experiencing soaring rates of infection – Cleburne county has 253.7 cases per 100,000 people, among the highest in the nation. Yet while many businesses including gyms and casinos have been ordered to close, some clothing stores remain open, US News reported. Asa Hutchinson, the governor, cited clothing stores on Thursday when he said people could lose their jobs if a wider order was put in place.

Of the southern states, Mississippi has the second-highest rate of coronaviruses cases per capita, yet the state’s governor, Tate Reeves, has been sluggish with his response. Reeves finally implemented a stay-at-home order on Wednesday 1 April, after weeks of confusion where the governor overruled cities and towns which had attempted their own orders, then defended his inaction by stating: “Mississippi’s never going to be North Korea”. The order came into effect on Friday. A Wallethub survey which considered each states’ prevention and containment measures to gauge the aggressiveness of their response, ranked Mississippi dead last. Oklahoma Oklahoma has added more than 100 new cases of coronavirus on each of the past four days, but is yet to implement a stay-at-home order. Governor Kevin Stitt has instead ordered a “Safer-At-Home” measure, which asks Oklahomans over 65 or those with a compromised immune system to only leave their homes for essential needs, like food shopping or collecting prescriptions. Epidemiologists have said extending social distancing orders to only the vulnerable, and not the wider population, is not effective. “In my opinion, I cannot shut things down and bunker in place,” Stitt said. Missouri Missouri saw a 600% rise in coronavirus cases over seven days at the end of March – the largest increase in the country, according to Johns Hopkins University. Despite that, Governor Mike Parson has said he will not introduce a stay-at-home order: “It’s very difficult sometimes to just put a blanket order in place,” Parson said on Thursday. Parson did not order schools to close as the seriousness of the coronavirus became apparent, instead leaving it to school districts to decide whether to close. All 555 did so. Some cities in Missouri, including St Louis and Kansas City, have issued their own stay-at-home orders, but leaders there have pleaded with Parson to introduce a statewide measure to prevent spread from rural communities. On Thursday, a column in the Kansas City Star summed up the governor’s lackadaisical response. It was headlined: “Missouri’s Mike Parson in contention for governor who’s done the least to contain Covid-19.” Reblog Share Tweet Share What to Read Next “You Just Asked Your Question In A Very Nasty Tone”: Donald Trump Lashes Out At CBS News Reporter’s Query About Jared Kushner Deadline 5 TSX Stocks for Building Wealth Motley Fool CanadaAd Coronavirus latest: at a glance The Guardian Detroit Bus Driver Who Implored Sick People To Stay Home Dies Of Coronavirus HuffPost Jane Fonda breaks the internet: Fire Drill Friday's first virtual protest crashes after thousands join online The Independent London Singles: 3 Online Dating Sites that Actually Work Top 10 Best Dating SitesAd Golf world awaiting British Open’s decision to reschedule majors amid coronavirus pandemic Yahoo Sports COVID-19 in Canada: PM Trudeau, Doug Ford express disappointment in Trump's trade 'mistake' Yahoo News Canada U.S. doctors seek protection from malpractice suits during outbreak Reuters Videos Single Moms in London Looking For a New Beginning Mature Quality SinglesAd 'This is so irresponsible': 'Covidiot' blogger faces backlash for leaving New York City after COVID-19 diagnosis Yahoo Canada Style 'Canada will lose every time:' COVID-19 pandemic threatens Canada-U.S. relations Yahoo News Canada London Zoo: Business as usual behind closed doors Reuters Videos A Natural Formula Can Help Knee and Back Pain Reqvo CreamAd The Latest: Chinese man jailed after not reporting travel The Canadian Press How Long Does Coronavirus Live In The Air?
